## Description
**Full paper link**: [Link](https://doi.org/10.1039/D4DD00113C)

Experimental design aims to efficiently collect informative data and derive meaningful conclusions while operating within resource constraints. We propose the use of a different framework with mixed-integer surrogates and acquisition functions, where we adopt [_PWAS_](https://github.com/mjzhu-p/PWAS) (Piecewise Affine Surrogate-based optimization), which is designed to address the challenges posed by mixed-variable problems subject to linear constraints. _PWAS_ enables the direct incorporation of discrete and mixed-variable decision variables, facilitating a more realistic representation of real-world problems. Moreover, _PWAS_ accommodates linear equality and inequality constraints commonly encountered in physical systems, ensuring feasible solutions are proposed. 

We demonstrate the effectiveness of _PWAS_ in optimizing experimental designs through three case studies, each with a different size of design space and numerical complexity: 
* Optimization of reaction conditions for **Suzukiâ€“Miyaura cross-coupling** (fully categorical) 
* Optimization of **crossed-barrel design** to augment mechanical toughness (mixed-integer)
* Solvent design for enhanced **Menschutkin reaction** rate (mixed-integer and categorical with linear constraints)

By comparing with conventional optimization algorithms, we offer insights into the practical applicability of _PWAS_.

We refer readers to the [**paper**](https://doi.org/10.1039/D4DD00113C) for detailed discussions.

## How to use this repository
The case studies and relevant files needed to reproduce the results in the paper are available.

To obtain a local copy of the repository:
~~~code
git clone https://github.com/MolChemML/ExpDesign.git
~~~

To run the case studies, the following steps need to be followed:

First, install the [_PWAS_](https://github.com/mjzhu-p/PWAS) package. 
  * ðŸ”´IMPORTANT: there are **external** dependencies of _PWAS_. See the package [repository](https://github.com/mjzhu-p/PWAS) for the detailed installation instructions for the MILP solvers used by _PWAS_. You can either obtain a free [academic license](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/) (if applicable) for [`GUROBI`](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/14799677517585-Getting-Started-with-Gurobi-Optimizer) or download the free [`GLPK`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17513666/installing-glpk-gnu-linear-programming-kit-on-windows) package or interface other MILP solvers following the instruction noted in [_PWAS_](https://github.com/mjzhu-p/PWAS). We used `GUROBI` for our case studies.
  * See an overview of _PWAS_ at [this section](#pwas)

Second, to run the case studies and the relevant analysis to generate figures, you need to include the following additional packages to load the dataset and export the results:
* [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) >= 2.1.0
* [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/) >= 3.1.2
* [seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/) >= 0.13.2
* [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) >= 3.8.3
* [sklearn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) >= 1.3.0

Other notes:
* For the information on each case study, please see the relevant folder noted at [Case studies](#casestudies)
* We used the [_Olympus_](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/olympus) package to run comparison studies. Please see the [forked version](https://github.com/mjzhu-p/olympus/tree/pwas_comp) for the relevant updates required to run the case studies.
    * ðŸ”´IMPORTANT: _Olympus_ require tensorflow==1.15, therefore, **python version < 3.8 is required**
    * The `yml` file used by the authors to run the comparison studies is included: [`olympus_pwas_comp.yml`](https://github.com/MolChemML/ExpDesign/blob/main/utils/olympus_pwas_comp.yml)

## Case studies
For Suzuki coupling and crossed barrel case studies, we compare the performances of _PWAS_ with the algorithms implemented in the following packages:
* [_Genetic_](https://github.com/DEAP/deap)
* [_Hyperopt_](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) (tpe)
* [_Botorch_](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch) (BO with GP)
* [_EDBO_](https://github.com/b-shields/edbo) (BO with GP trained on reaction optimization data)
Additionally, we also consider _Random Search_ as a baseline

We note that _Random Search_, _Genetic_, _Hyperopt_, and _BoTorch_ have been interfaced in the [_Olympus_](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/olympus) package; therefore, we use the algorithmic structure implemented in the
package for benchmark tests with their default solver parameters. A customized forked version tailored for our testing is also available on GitHub at [Branch â€œpwas_compâ€œ](https://github.com/mjzhu-p/olympus/tree/pwas_comp), which you can see all the modifications. Note, some modifications are only necessary for Windows systems.

The tests were repeated **30** times. Within each run, the maximum iteration was set to **50**, with 10 initial samples.

As for the solvent design case study, due to the relatively large number of constraints involved, comparisons with the aforementioned solvers are impractical, instead, it is compared with a recently proposed [_DoE-QM-CAMD_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135423002156#sec4)  method.
